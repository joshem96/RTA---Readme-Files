## Known Issues

- **Random Character Bug:** Occasionally, random characters may appear in the eBay data when the extension is used for the first time or after clearing your cache. If this happens, a notification will prompt you to refresh your browser.

- **Australia Post Timeout:** Australia Post may automatically log you out quickly. If you encounter an error such as "Post Fees Not Generated" despite being logged in, you might have been logged out. Please log in again.

- If you encounter any other issues, we recommend fully loading the eBay page first, followed by the Australia Post page, and then generating your sales data via the "Get Ebay Sales" button. Ensure that you have selected a valid one-month date range in ebay as well.
