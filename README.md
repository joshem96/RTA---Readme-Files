## Sales And Post Fees Summary

- **eBay Sales Summary:** Generate a table of all your eBay sales within a specific one-month period. The table includes item titles, links, and net sale amounts.

- **Australia Post Fees Summary:** Generate a table displaying postage fees and corresponding dates. 

- **Data Copying:** Easily copy your eBay sales and or Australia Post fees data to the clipboard. Use the drop down to select which data you want to copy.

## My Post Business Tools

- **Default Form Settings:** Automatically turn on tracking, "no" for dangerous goods, clear description/reference and remove ebay tag in address field
- **Info Overlays:** Turn on overlays which can present user data fixed on screen while editing so you can easily see vital info about the item being processed.

## Known Issues

- **Random Character Bug:** Occasionally, random characters may appear in the eBay data when the extension is used for the first time or after clearing your cache. If this happens, a notification will prompt you to refresh your browser.

- **Australia Post Timeout:** Australia Post may automatically log you out quickly. If you encounter an error such as "Post Fees Not Generated" despite being logged in, you might have been logged out. Please log in again.

- If you encounter any other issues, we recommend fully loading the eBay page first, followed by the Australia Post page, and then generating your sales data via the "Get Ebay Sales" button. Ensure that you have selected a valid one-month date range in ebay as well.
